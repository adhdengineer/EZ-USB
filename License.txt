All this stuff is based off the Cypress FX2 bulk loop example code.
The changes made to it are purely for educational purposes, if you base any commercial product off the changes and it goes tits up, on your head be it.
Cypress have permission to the changes and bundle them up with their SDK, if they want to.
If you find this code useful (or not) and you ever meet me in the pub then you can buy me a pint.
